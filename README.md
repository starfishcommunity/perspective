# Perspective

The Project Name is called "perspective", in Tamil (google it) it also means forward thinking.

# Why?
Take the keywords coming out of Crypto and can you see the folllowing words "Inclusive design", "micro-credit", "poverty", "climate-change".
The Decentrilization movement should be more more inclusive, there are different view points when you build a complex system,
and perspective is one of them.

# What has Starfish has to do something with this?
Starfish Mission is a pioneering hub for the blockchain community - founded by the Starfish Network. Starfish Network is dedicated to creating spaces and learning opportunities for the community which inspires the Starfish team.

# A short story 
<< Ann Marie>> and Starfish team created this amazing project which includes audio visual mechanism for adding an artisitic element 
to understand blockchain. Ann has wisely created anIntenet Pixel TV, which we call as "StarBoard". Starboard has the following components.
a 4x5 pixels 
                   StarBoard
                
                  | .  .  .  .  |
                  | .  .  .  .  |
                  | .  .  .  .  |
                  | .  .  .  .  |
                  | .  .  .  .  |
                  
Now Imagine that you can light these individual pixels with messages from People who have donated their crypto to their favorite charity.
For e.g let's say Masha donates to her fav charity "black girls who code" and she donates for her favoriate niece in the whole
wide world "To Sasha-from Ant" [15 chars), the message can be displayed on the Starboard which each pixel represent a character. 

# Proposal 

I propose that Starboard get's live-streamed for a fixed amount time, so when in this case Masha donates to her fav neice Sasha for her
coding class she can see the Starboard light up. This is just the begining now let us all use our imagination.

# How can you help?

Coding and Devops  help is needed, but all are welcome to participate.
